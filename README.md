## My Process
### Built With
   - Semantic HTML5 Custom Properties

   - CSS Grid

### What I Learnt
 I could use css flexbox and grid properties and create a nice site like for this one on social links profile.

### Continued Development
I will work more on box model and flexbox properties to ensure full harness of the css properties.
